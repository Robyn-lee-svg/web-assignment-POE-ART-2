            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <P>Our bakery fisrt came too be in 1989, when charly and jacqui biess opened a restaurant in thibault squrae. We then decided to expand by moving to the V&A waterfront, which is were our popularity increaced– our yummy breakfasts and lunch buffets had people queuing for hours.But as you know there can be too much of a good time,we decided then and there that we needed to  downsize and opened a wholesale cake bakery in Roeland Street. Which as expected the delious aromas attracted the attention of the office workers at the neigbouring advertisment agency.</P>
            <p2>Soon after our success we realised that we could create something fun and unique in Cape Town by re-opening to the public and specialising in beautiful baked cakes and cupcakes. The more fun we had, the more quirky we became, and when Alexandra, and later Daniella and Roch, joined the business, we became the Charly’s Bakery as you know it today.</p2>
            <p3>It first started with our cupcakes and a few words written our sweet treats, but it soon became clear that the fun we were having was starting to create something magical. When we introduced "charly-ism" (which is basically us putting glitter on everyting), it was only a matter of time before we made our mark in Cape Town cake scene. Which in turn, the charly brand was born!</p3>
            <p4>We became known for our vibrent colours, exciting and unusual cakes, but most of all, our belief in saying YES to whatever we could – no task was too much! This business ethic meant that as the business grew, so did our desire to produce more spectacular creations.In 2010 we caught the attention of local production company, Cooked in Africa, who we partnered with to produce our docu-reality TV series, Charly’s Cake Angels, which premiered in South Africa in October 2011 and internationally on January 1st 2012. Season 2 premiered on September 16th 2013 to audiences in more than 100 countries, and our TV show has been watched on almost every continent.</p4><br><br>
